However, datatype-generic libraries in Agda are not reused as much as they should be, because traditionally they work only on datatypes decoded from a library‚Äôs own version of datatype descriptions; this means that different generic libraries cannot be used together, and they do not work on native datatypes, which are preferred by the practical Agda programmer for better language support and access to other libraries. Based on elaborator reflection, we present a framework in Agda featuring a set of general metaprograms for instantiating datatype-generic programs as, and for, a useful range of native datatypes and functions ‚Äîincluding universe-polymorphic ones‚Äî in programmer-friendly and customisable forms. We expect that datatype-generic libraries built with our framework will be more attractive to the practical Agda programmer.

Recently Kavvos (2017) extended PCF with <code>Code</code> <i>A</i> and intensional recursion, understood as the deductive form of the <b>GL</b> (G√∂del-L√∂b) axiom in provability logic, but the resulting type system is logically inconsistent. Inspired by staged computation, we observe that a term of type <code>Code</code> <i>A</i> is, in general, code to be evaluated in a next stage, whereas <b>S4</b> modal type theory is a special case where code can be evaluated in the current stage, and the two types of code should be discriminated. Consequently, we use two separate modalities <code>‚ä†</code> and <code>‚ñ°</code> to model <b>S4</b> and <b>GL</b> respectively in a unified categorical framework while retaining logical consistency. Following Kavvos‚Äô (2017) novel approach to the semantics of intensionality, we interpret the two modalities in the ùí´-category of assemblies and trackable maps. For the <b>GL</b> modality <code>‚ñ°</code> in particular, we use guarded type theory to articulate what it means by a ‚Äúnext‚Äù stage and to model intensional recursion by guarded recursion together with Kleene‚Äôs second recursion theorem. Besides validating the S4 and GL axioms, our model better captures the essence of intensionality by refuting congruence (so that two extensionally equal terms may not be intensionally equal) and internal quoting (both <i>A</i> ‚Üí <code>‚ñ°</code><i>A</i> and <i>A</i> ‚Üí <code>‚ä†</code><i>A</i>).

In this paper, we present an alternative that achieves the best of both worlds, namely good performance and transactional properties. Our key observation is that, because of the frequent use of synchronization primitives, systems with strong durability can hardly utilize the extremely high parallelism granted by modern storage devices. Thus, we explore the notion of weakly durable transactions, and discuss how to safely relax durability without compromising other transactional properties. We present AciKV, a transactional system whose design is centered around weak durability. AciKV exposes to users the normal transactional interface, but what sets it apart from others is a new ‚Äúpersist‚Äù primitive that decouples durability from commit. AciKV is a middle ground between systems that perform fast atomic operations, and ones that support transactions; this middle ground is useful as it provides similar performance to the former, while prevents isolation and consistency anomalies like the latter. Our evaluation using the YCSB benchmark shows that AciKV, under workloads that involve write requests, exhibits more than two orders of magnitude higher throughput than existing strongly durable systems.", Nothing)

This is an unfortunate situation, as many bx tools are developed and maintained by practically-oriented bx researchers, who would but currently cannot fully profit from formal results and insights. In particular, we are not aware of any practical implementation of C-lenses, not even preliminary discussions about its relevance to practical bx. We believe this is because of the inaccessibility of the categorical language, and write this paper to decipher C-lenses for bx researchers without any substantial background in category theory.

Besides saving the effort of writing separate proofs, a most distinguishing and fascinating aspect of dependently typed programming is that it makes the idea of <em>interactive type-driven development</em> much more powerful, where expressive type information becomes useful hints that help the programmer to complete a program. There have not been many attempts at exploiting the full potential of the idea, though. As a departure from the usual properties dealt with in dependently typed programming, and as a demonstration that the idea of interactive type-driven development has more potential to be discovered, we conduct an experiment in ‚Äòtype-driven algorithm design‚Äô: we develop algorithms from their specifications encoded in sophisticated types, to see how useful the hints provided by a type-aware interactive development environment can be. The algorithmic problem we choose is <em>metamorphisms</em>, whose definitional behaviour is consuming a data structure to compute an intermediate value and then producing a codata structure from that value, but there are other ways to compute metamorphisms.

More specifically, the flush operation of SCFTL also has the functionality of making a ‚Äúdisk snapshot.‚Äù When a crash occurs, the flash disk is guaranteed to recover to the state right before the last flush. The major benefit of SCFTL is that it allows a more efficient design of upper layers in the storage stack. For example, the file system built on SCFTL does not require the use of a journal for crash recovery. Instead, it only needs to perform a flush operation of SCFTL at the end of each atomic transaction. We use a combination of a proof assistant, a symbolic executor, and an SMT solver, to formally verify the correctness of our SCFTL implementation. We modify the xv6 file system to support group commit and utilize SCFTL‚Äôs stronger crash guarantee. Our evaluation using file system benchmarks shows that the modified xv6 on SCFTL is 3 to 30 times faster than xv6 with logging on conventional FTLs, and is in the worst case only two times slower than the state-of-the-art setting: the ext4 file system on the Physical Block Device (pblk) FTL.", Nothing)

Despite being two closely related programs, in practice they are often designed separately, and then need to be revised and kept consistent as the language evolves. It will be more convenient if the parser and printer can be unified and developed in a single program, with their consistency guaranteed automatically. Furthermore, in certain scenarios (like showing compiler optimisation results to the programmer), it is desirable to have a more powerful <em>reflective</em> printer that, when an abstract syntax tree corresponding to a piece of program text is modified, can propagate the modification to the program text while preserving layouts, comments, and syntactic sugar.</p><p>To address these needs, we propose a domain-specific language BiYacc, whose programs denote both a parser and a reflective printer for a fully disambiguated context-free grammar. BiYacc is based on the theory of bidirectional transformations, which helps to guarantee by construction that the generated pairs of parsers and reflective printers are consistent. Handling grammatical ambiguity is particularly challenging: we propose an approach based on generalised parsing and disambiguation filters, which produce all the parse results and (try to) select the only correct one in the parsing direction; the filters are carefully bidirectionalised so that they also work in the printing direction and do not break the consistency between the parsers and reflective printers.

Due to their heterogeneity, however, the numerous and diverse approaches to bx are difficult to compare, with the consequence that fundamental differences and similarities are not yet well understood. This motivates the need for suitable benchmarks that facilitate the comparison of bx approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of benchmarking bx, covering theory, implementation, application, and assessment. At the level of theory, we introduce a conceptual framework that defines and classifies architectures of bx tools. At the level of implementation, we describe <em>Benchmarx</em>, an infrastructure for benchmarking bx tools which is based on the conceptual framework. At the level of application, we report on a wide variety of solutions to the well-known Families-to-Persons benchmark, which were developed and compared with the help of Benchmarx.

While lenses are designed to retain information in the source when the view is modified, well-behavedness says very little about the retaining of information: Hippocraticness only requires that the source be unchanged if the view is not modified, and nothing about information retention is guaranteed when the view is changed. To address the problem, we propose an extension of the original lenses, called <em>retentive lenses</em>, which satisfy a new Retentiveness law guaranteeing that if parts of the view are unchanged, then the corresponding parts of the source are retained as well. As a concrete example of retentive lenses, we present a domain-specific language for writing tree transformations; we prove that the pair of <em>get</em> and <em>put</em> functions generated from a program in our DSL forms a retentive lens. We demonstrate the practical use of retentive lenses and the DSL by presenting case studies on code refactoring, Pombrio and Krishnamurthi‚Äôs resugaring, and XML synchronisation.", Nothing)

Most of these languages are based on a declarative programming model, and only allow the programmer to describe a consistency specification with ad hoc and/or awkward control over the consistency restoration behaviour. However, synchronisation problems are diverse and require vastly different consistency restoration strategies, and to cope with the diversity, the programmer must have the ability to fully control and reason about the consistency restoration behaviour. The putback-based approach to bidirectional programming aims to provide exactly this ability, and this paper strengthens the putback-based position by proposing the first fully fledged reasoning framework for a bidirectional language ‚Äî a Hoare-style logic for Ko et al.‚Äôs [2016] putback-based language BiGUL. The Hoare-style logic lets the BiGUL programmer precisely characterise the bidirectional behaviour of their programs by reasoning solely in the putback direction, thereby offering a unidirectional programming abstraction that is reasonably straightforward to work with and yet provides full control not achieved by previous approaches. The theory has been formalised and checked in Agda, but this paper presents the Hoare-style logic in a semi-formal way to make it easily understood and usable by the working BiGUL programmer.", Nothing)

Some domain-specific languages (DSLs) have been proposed to provide more intuitive ways to implement graph algorithms, but due to the lack of support for <em>remote access</em> ‚Äî reading or writing attributes of other vertices through references ‚Äî they cannot handle the above mentioned dynamic communication, causing a class of Pregel algorithms with fast convergence impossible to implement.</p><p>To address this problem, we design and implement Palgol, a more declarative and powerful DSL which supports remote access.

By analyzing the logic patterns of chain access, we provide a novel algorithm for compiling Palgol programs to efficient Pregel code.

In this paper, we design and implement a concise core language BiGUL for putback-based bidirectional programming to serve as a foundation for higher-level putback-based languages. BiGUL is completely formally verified in the dependently typed programming language Agda to guarantee that any putback transformation written in BiGUL is well-behaved.", Nothing)

This approach has an obvious disadvantage: as a language evolves, both its parser and printer need to be separately revised and kept synchronised. Such tasks are routine but complicated and error-prone. To facilitate these tasks, we propose a language called BiYacc, whose programs denote both a parser and a printer. In essence, BiYacc is a domain-specific language for writing <em>putback-based</em> bidirectional transformations ‚Äî the printer is a putback transformation, and the parser is the corresponding get transformation. The pairs of parsers and printers generated by BiYacc are thus always guaranteed to satisfy the usual round-trip properties. The highlight that distinguishes this <em>reflective</em> printer from others is that the printer ‚Äî being a putback transformation ‚Äî accepts not only an abstract syntax tree but also a string, and produces an updated string consistent with the given abstract syntax tree. We can thus make use of the additional input string, with mechanisms such as simultaneous pattern matching on the view and the source, to provide users with full control over the printing-strategies.", Nothing)

Two modes of programming can then be distinguished: in <em>externalism</em>, we construct a program separately from its correctness proof with respect to a given specification, whereas in <em>internalism</em>, we encode the specification in a sophisticated type such that any program inhabiting the type also encodes a correctness proof, and we can use type information as a guidance on program construction. Internalism is particularly effective in the presence of <em>inductive families</em>, whose design can have a strong influence on program structure. Techniques and mechanisms for facilitating internalist programming are still lacking, however.</p><p>This dissertation proposes that internalist programming can be facilitated by exploiting an interconnection between internalism and externalism, expressed as isomorphisms between inductive families into which data structure invariants are encoded and their simpler variants paired with predicates expressing those invariants. The interconnection has two directions: one <em>analysing</em> inductive families into simpler variants and predicates, and the other <em>synthesising</em> inductive families from simpler variants and specific predicates. They respectively give rise to two applications, one achieving a modular structure of internalist libraries, and the other bridging internalist programming with relational specifications and program derivation. The datatype-generic mechanisms supporting the applications are based on McBride‚Äôs <em>ornaments</em>. Theoretically, the key ornamental constructs ‚Äî <em>parallel composition of ornaments</em> and <em>relational algebraic ornamentation</em> ‚Äî are further characterised in terms of lightweight category theory. Most of the results are completely formalised in the Agda programming language.", Nothing)

McBride‚Äôs algebraic ornamentation provides a methodological advancement, by which the programmer can derive a datatype from a specification involving a fold, such that a program that constructs elements of that datatype would be correct by construction. It is thus an effective method that leads the programmer from a specification to a dependently typed program. We enhance the applicability of this method by generalising algebraic ornamentation to a relational setting and bringing in relational algebraic methods, resulting in a hybrid approach that makes essential use of both dependently typed programming and relational program derivation. A dependently typed solution to the minimum coin change problem is presented as a demonstration of this hybrid approach. We also give a theoretically interesting ‚Äòcompleteness theorem‚Äô of relational algebraic ornaments, which sheds some light on the expressive power of ornaments and inductive families.", Nothing)
