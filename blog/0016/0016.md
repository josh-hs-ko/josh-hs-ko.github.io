An important special case of adjunctions is Galois connections, which can be very helpful for reasoning about order-theoretic optimising definitions.

## A study of adjunctions: Galois connections

Continuing [0015](/blog/0015/), here we look at what the isomorphisms give us in the important special case of preorder categories (whose objects are elements of a preorder and whose morphisms represent inequalities).
The universal property of products specialises to the usual two-clause definition of greatest lower bounds: given elements $x$ and $y$ of a preorder, an element $x \sqcap y$ is a greatest lower bound of $x$ and $y$ exactly when

* $x \sqcap y$ is a lower bound of $x$ and $y$, that is, $x \sqcap y \leq x$ and $x \sqcap y \leq y$, and
* any lower bound of $x$ and $y$ is below $x \sqcap y$, that is, $z \leq x$ and $z \leq y$ implies $z \leq x \sqcap y$.

Categorically, the first clause assembles the object $x \sqcap y$ and the two morphisms $x \sqcap y \leq x$ and $x \sqcap y \leq y$ into a span object of a (derived) span category where we consider only lower bounds of $x$ and $y$ and the preorder restricted to these lower bounds, and the second clause says that this particular span is terminal, that is, $x \sqcap y$ is the greatest element in this derived preorder of lower bounds.
On the other hand, the family of product isomorphisms specialises to

$$ \forall z.\ z \leq x \mathrel\wedge z \leq y ~\Leftrightarrow~ z \leq x \sqcap y $$

If $x \sqcap y$ exists for all $x$ and $y$, then we can make $(\sqcap)$ a function, and the above statement should hold for all $x$ and $y$:

$$ \forall x, y, z.\ z \leq x \mathrel\wedge z \leq y ~\Leftrightarrow~ z \leq x \sqcap y $$

Being equivalent to the universal property, this statement fixes $(\sqcap)$ up to isomorphism, so if the preorder is in fact a partial order (where isomorphism implies equality), this statement will serve as a definition of $(\sqcap)$.
Being able to read and write such ‘isomorphisms’ intuitively can save us a lot of time.
In this case, the function being defined is $(\sqcap)$, which is supposed to compute the greatest lower bound, an optimisation (greatest) with respect to a property (lower bound).
The property is written on the left-hand side: $z \leq x \mathrel\wedge z \leq y$ says $z$ is a lower bound of $x$ and $y$.
And since we want to find the greatest element satisfying the property, on the right-hand side we put the thing being defined, namely $x \sqcap y$, on the larger side of the inequality.
Then the left-to-right implication says that any lower bound $z$ is below $x \sqcap y$, and by substituting $x \sqcap y$ for $z$, the right-to-left implication tells us that $x \sqcap y$ is a lower bound (since $(\leq)$ is reflexive).

It would be strange if whatever statement that looks like the one above always properly defined a function — we could have written some nonsense after all, in which case we couldn’t have defined anything.
To make sure that we’re writing a sensible definition, we should ensure that the statement has the form

$$ \forall x : P, y : Q.\ f\ x \leq_Q y ~\Leftrightarrow~ x \leq_P g\ y $$

for some preorders $P$ and $Q$ and order-preserving functions $f : P \to Q$ and $g : Q \to P$; if $f$ satisfies certain conditions (which we will see in a later post), then $g$ will be properly defined.
This specialises the general form of isomorphisms we caught a glimpse of at the end of [0015](/blog/0015/) to preorder categories, and is called a [Galois connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_connection).

Again, together with the technique of indirect reasoning, which specialises for partial orders to

$$ x = y \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \forall z.\ z \leq x \Leftrightarrow z \leq y $$

we can reason about order-theoretic optimising definitions very easily.
For example, reasoning about the [floor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions) can be a pain without the help of the right Galois connection.
In Section 3.2 of Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik’s [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) they use

$$ \left\lfloor \sqrt{\lfloor r \rfloor} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \sqrt{r} \right\rfloor \qquad\text{for real } r \geq 0 $$

as a first non-trivial property about floors.
But if we characterise the floor function as finding the greatest integer below a real number,

$$ \forall n : \mathbb Z^{0+}, r : \mathbb R^{0+}. \mathsf{inj}\ n \leq_{\mathbb R^{0+}} r ~\Leftrightarrow~ n \leq_{\mathbb Z^{0+}} \lfloor r \rfloor $$

where $\mathsf{inj} : \mathbb Z^{0+} \to \mathbb R^{0+}$ promotes a non-negative integer to a non-negative real number (and will be omitted in the reasoning below), then the property becomes very easy to prove:

\begin{align*}
& n \leq_{\mathbb Z^{0+}} \left\lfloor \sqrt{\lfloor r \rfloor} \right\rfloor \\\\
\Leftrightarrow~& \reason{Galois connection for floors} \\\\
& n \leq_{\mathbb R^{0+}} \sqrt{\lfloor r \rfloor} \\\\
\Leftrightarrow~& \reason{square root} \\\\
& n^2 \leq_{\mathbb R^{0+}} \lfloor r \rfloor \\\\
\Leftrightarrow~& \reason{both sides are integers} \\\\
& n^2 \leq_{\mathbb Z^{0+}} \lfloor r \rfloor \\\\
\Leftrightarrow~& \reason{Galois connection for floors} \\\\
& n^2 \leq_{\mathbb R^{0+}} r \\\\
\Leftrightarrow~& \reason{square root} \\\\
& n \leq_{\mathbb R^{0+}} \sqrt{r} \\\\
\Leftrightarrow~& \reason{Galois connection for floors} \\\\
& n \leq_{\mathbb Z^{0+}} \left\lfloor \sqrt{r} \right\rfloor
\end{align*}

Similar to what we did with the commutativity of products in [0015](/blog/0015/), the crux of this reasoning is using the Galois connection to switch to the more liberal domain of real numbers to deal with the square root.
